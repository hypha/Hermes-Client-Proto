# Description

This is the prototype client for the Hermes project.

# Getting started

## On Ubuntu Linux:
If you don't already have an up-to-date node.js environment, start by installing it:
```bash
sudo apt-get install npm nodejs-legacy
```

Assuming you have a working node.js and npm installation, first clone the repository, then change into the directory and run:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The last command will start the server, listening on http://localhost:8080/

## On Windows:

No friggin' idea. Any volunteers? :-D

# Code map

TBD
